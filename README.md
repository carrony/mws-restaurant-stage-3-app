#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage Two**,
 you will take the responsive, accessible design you built in Stage One and connect it to an external server. You’ll begin by using asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. You’ll store data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture. Finally, you’ll work to optimize your site to meet performance benchmarks, which you’ll test using Lighthouse.

### Specification

You will be provided code for an updated Node development server and a README for getting the server up and running locally on your computer. The README will also contain the API you will need to make JSON requests to the server. Once you have the server up, you will begin the work of improving your Stage Two project code.

    This server is different than the server from stage 2, and has added capabilities. Make sure you are using the Stage Three server as you develop your project. Connecting to this server is the same as with Stage Two, however.

You can find the documentation for the new server in the README file for the server.

Now that you’ve connected your application to an external database, it’s time to begin adding new features to your app.

### Requirements

Add a form to allow users to create their own reviews: In previous versions of the application, users could only read reviews from the database. You will need to add a form that adds new reviews to the database. The form should include the user’s name, the restaurant id, the user’s rating, and whatever comments they have. Submitting the form should update the server when the user is online.

Add functionality to defer updates until the user is connected: If the user is not online, the app should notify the user that they are not connected, and save the users' data to submit automatically when re-connected. In this case, the review should be deferred and sent to the server when connection is re-established (but the review should still be visible locally even before it gets to the server.)

Meet the new performance requirements: In addition to adding new features, the performance targets you met in Stage Two have tightened. Using Lighthouse, you’ll need to measure your site performance against the new targets.

    Progressive Web App score should be at 90 or better.
    Performance score should be at 90 or better.
    Accessibility score should be at 90 or better.
